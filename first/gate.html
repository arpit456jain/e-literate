              <b>GATE or the Graduate Aptitude Test </b>in Engineering is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of candidates in various undergraduate subjects of engineering and science for admission into the Masters Program of institutes as well as jobs at Public Sector Companies. GATE is conducted jointly by the Indian Institute of Science, IIT Roorkee, IIT Delhi, IIT Guwahati, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras and IIT Bombay on behalf of the National Coordination Board – GATE, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), Government of India. With IIT Bombay being the organizer for 2021.
              The GATE score of a candidate is valid for 3 years and reflects the relative performance level of a candidate. The score is used for admissions to various post-graduate education programs including Master of Engineering, Master of Technology, Master of Architecture, Doctor of Philosophy etc. in Indian higher education institutes, with financial assistance provided by MHRD and other government agencies. Recently, GATE scores are also being used by several Indian public sector undertakings for recruiting graduate engineers in entry-level positions.

                The candidate can appear for the exam in any of the 27 subjects in which the exam is conducted. The subjects include statistics, mathematics, computer science and information technology, aerospace engineering etc. Earlier there were 25 subjects. 2 new subjects - Environmental Science and Engineering (ES) and Humanities and Social Science (XS) – have been added this year. 
                The examination is of 3 hours duration, and contains a total of 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. The examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of the following types of questions:
                </p> 
                <ul>
                  <li>Multiple-Choice Questions in which ONE option is correct. They usually have 1 or 2 marks for the correct answer and 1/3rd marks are deducted for wrong answer.</li>
                  <li>Multiple Select Questions in which ONE or MORE than ONE options is/are correct. They usually do not have negative marks.</li>
                 <li> Numerical Answer Type questions whose answers are real numbers that are to be entered via an on-screen keyboard and computer mouse. They do not have negative marks.</li>

                </ul> 
              <p>
                Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. <br> <br>
                Out of 65 questions, 10 questions are from General Aptitude (Verbal and Numerical ability) and 55 questions are Technical, based on the Paper chosen. The General Aptitude section has 5 One-mark questions and 5 Two-mark questions. The Technical section and Engineering Mathematics section combinedly have 25 One-mark questions and 30 Two-mark questions.

                  <p>Unlike undergraduate admissions in India, candidates must apply individually to each institute after the institute has published its M.Tech. notification. There is no separate counselling held. For admissions in NITs and IIITs, CCMT is held every year and the notification is released around April of each year.<br><br>
                  Some institutions specify GATE qualification as mandatory even for admission of self-financing students to postgraduate programs. GATE qualified candidates are also eligible for the award of Junior Research Fellowship in CSIR Laboratories and CSIR sponsored projects. <br><br>
                  Typically, the Indian Institute of Science and Indian Institutes of Technology are the most selective followed by National Institutes of Technology and others. Also, there are some state universities in India, whose standards and facilities are very much comparable to top IITs and NITs. Some of them are Punjab Engineering College, Bengal Engineering and Science University (recently converted to IIEST) and some more.
