        After the candidate completes his graduation in chemical engineering, he can appear for GATE in the chemistry paper (CH) that is one of the 27 disciplines prescribed by GATE. GATE is an examination that primarily tests the comprehensive understanding of candidates in various undergraduate subjects of engineering and science for admission into the Master’s Program of institutes as well as jobs at Public Sector Companies. The syllabus of GATE for chemical engineering mainly includes the following:

         <p class="my-3">
           After qualifying GATE, the candidate can go for further studies like post-graduation and Ph. D. from top tier institutes including IITs and NITs and receive stipend and fellowships based on the performance in the respective course or can apply for job in a PSU. Many PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings) prefer candidates from chemical engineering background among some other selected branches owing to the nature of services they provide and the nature of products they manufacture or deal with.
         </p>
      
        <p>
          Some such PSUs that prefer candidates from chemical engineering as their major field of study include:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <b> BIS </b> <br>
        Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) shortlists candidates for the interview on the basis of GATE scores. The shortlisted candidates need to appear for the personal interview after completion of the document verification process. The final list of selected candidates is prepared on the basis of merit determined by the aggregate marks obtained by giving 85% weightage to GATE scores and the remaining 15% weightage to marks secured in the interview. The recruitments are conducted for the post of Scientist Grade ‘B’.
      </li>

      <li> <b> IOCL </b> <br>
        The applications are open from April to June. Recruitments are made on the basis of GATE scores and performance in the interview. Recruitments are conducted for various posts depending on qualification. Graduate engineers are recruited as Engineers/Officers, Post – graduate engineers are recruited as Research Officers in Research and Development Center.
        </li>  

      <li> <b> DRDO </b> <br>
        Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) recruits graduate engineer candidates with chemical engineering as their major discipline. The applications are open during June-July. DRDO conducts a three – step process for recruitment of candidates on the basis of their GATE scores for the post of Scientist Grade ‘B’. The steps include shortlisting through GATE scores, descriptive examination and personal interview.
      </li>

      <li> <b> BARC </b> <br>
        Candidates with valid GATE scores can apply for programs as per the specified eligibility. Non – GATE candidates can also apply for the programs by appearing for an online test. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of their performance in GATE or the BARC online test for the interview. Thereafter, the selected candidates are called for a final interview in Mumbai. Candidates who clear the interview are selected as Scientific Officers. 
       </li>  

        <li> <b> PSPCL </b> <br>
        The Punjab government owned company responsible for power generation and distribution in the state, recruits Assistant Engineers (On Training) on the basis of Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) scores. Another requirement that the candidate must have passed Punjabi of at least Matriculation level or its equivalent up to the date of document checking.
      </li>

        <li> <b> NPCIL </b> <br>
        Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is a PSU under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India. It has postponed the application process for recruitment through GATE for this year. Selection for the interview is on the basis of GATE scores. The performance in interview determines the final selection. The selected candidates have to undergo one-year orientation training in any of Nuclear Training Centers of NPCIL.
