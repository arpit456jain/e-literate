      <p class="mt-3">Mentioned above is the outlined syllabus for GATE. There are minor changes being introduced frequently in the syllabus as well as the nature and weightage of questions.</p>
      <p>After qualifying GATE, the candidate can go for further studies like post-graduation and Ph. D. from top tier institutes including IITs and NITs and receive stipend and fellowships based on the performance in the respective course or can apply for job in a PSU. Many PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings) prefer candidates from electrical engineering background among some other selected branches owing to the nature of services they provide and the nature of products they manufacture or deal with.</p>
      <p>Some such PSUs that prefer candidates from electrical engineering as their major field of study include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Airport Authority of India </b> <br>
          The applications are open during August. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of their GATE scores. The shortlisted candidates need to report for document verification for final selection. There are about 180 vacancies per year. </li>
          <li> <b>NTPC Limited</b> <br>
            The applications are open during June – July. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of GATE scores. Thereafter, the shortlisted candidates need to qualify a group discussion that is followed by personal interview. The final merit list is prepared on the basis of the candidate’s performance in all stages of the recruitment process. Selected candidates are required to undergo a medical test conducted by a board of medical officers of NTPC. 
          </li>
          <li> <b>KIOCL Limited</b> <br>
            The applications are open during July. The candidates are shortlisted on the basis of their GATE scores and are called for interview. Selected candidates need to undergo a medical test and must fulfil the required fitness requirements for recruitment.
          </li>
          <li> <b>IOCL</b> <br>
            The applications are open from April to June. Recruitments are made on the basis of GATE scores and performance in the interview. Recruitments are conducted for various posts depending on qualification. Graduate engineers are recruited as Engineers/Officers, Post – graduate engineers are recruited as Research Officers in Research and Development Center.  
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>NALCO</b> <br>
            <p>The candidates who qualified GATE are eligible to apply for National Aluminum Company Limited (NALCO). Candidates shortlisted on the basis of GATE scores are required to appear for a personal interview where document verification is done simultaneously. Selected candidates undergo training for a period of 1 year. Thereafter they are recruited as Junior Manager. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>DRDO</b> <br>
            <p>The applications are open during June-July. DRDO conducts a three – step process for recruitment of candidates on the basis of their GATE scores for the post of Scientist Grade ‘B’. The steps include shortlisting through GATE scores, descriptive examination and personal interview.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>ISRO</b> <br>
            <p>The recruitment process of ISRO through GATE is much similar to that of DRDO with some minor variations. ISRO shortlists candidates on the basis of their GATE scores for a written test consisting of objective type questions. After that, the qualified candidates are called for personal interview. If the candidate scores minimum 60% marks in the interview, he will be shortlisted for being eligible for appearing in the empanelment in the selection panel.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>NPCIL</b> <br>
            <p>
              Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is a PSU under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India.
